## Introduction

This repository contains a collection of Python tutorials designed to help you master Python programming. The tutorials start with basic concepts like syntax and variables, and gradually progress to more advanced topics such as object-oriented programming (OOP), file handling, and error handling.

The tutorials include explanations, code examples, and exercises to solidify your understanding of each topic.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Python tutorials:

1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ntanmay10/python.git

Navigate to the directory:

    cd python

    Install Python (if you don't have it already):
        Download and install the latest version of Python from python.org.
        Ensure that Python is added to your system's PATH environment variable.

    Open any tutorial file in your preferred text editor or IDE to start learning.

# Introduction to Python

Learn the basics of Python, including setting up your environment, running Python scripts, and understanding Python syntax.

# Variables and Data Types

Explore Python's built-in data types (such as int, float, str, list, and dict), and learn how to declare and use variables.

# Control Flow

Understand how to make decisions in your code using conditional statements (if, else, elif) and loops (for, while).

# Functions

Learn how to define and call functions in Python, including parameters, return values, and function scope.

# Modules and Packages

Discover how to organize your Python code using modules and packages, and how to import and use them in your programs.

# File Handling

Understand how to work with files in Python, including reading from and writing to text files.

# Object-Oriented Programming

Dive into object-oriented programming concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism in Python.

Before you start with the Python tutorials, make sure you have:

    A computer with Python installed.
    A basic understanding of programming concepts like variables, loops, and conditionals (optional, but helpful).
    A text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for writing Python code (e.g., VSCode, PyCharm, Sublime Text, etc.).

If you're a complete beginner, don't worryâ€”this tutorial is designed to start from the basics!
